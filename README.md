# Project Title

Machine learning life cycle management 

## Getting Started

These instructions are for how to set up and to connect to MLFLOW service. 
Steps :

1. order MLFLOW instance for your organization. What this order means ?
   1.1 creating an openshift/sebshift service that listens to your model metrics 
   1.2 creating user name and password so as your team can access the mlflow instance 
   1.3 creating a db in the MSSQL server that we maintain for storing machine learning models metrics
   1.4 creating a SSH keey that you need to install to your training enviroment so as to be able to store the models to the         model registry . 

2. download the recommended version of mlflow library to your training enviroment. pip install mlflow is the command.
3. connect your training cod e
  

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
